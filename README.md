## Environment Setup

First go to the location where your project exsists and create file named as requirements.txt
Then make a conda environment using the Anaconda prompt

```bash
conda create -n name_for_the_environment python=3.8
```

After creating, activate it,
```bash
name_of_environment python=3.8
```

Then go to the location where your project wants to create and run the command using package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
